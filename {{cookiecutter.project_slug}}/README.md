## Run the application

* `$ docker-compose build`
* `$ docker-compose run --rm app alembic upgrade head`

### Run

`$ docker-compose up --build`

### Async Worker Emails

To demonstrate usage of the asynchronous `SAQ` workers, when an `Author` is created we trigger a
worker function that sends an email.

`mailhog` is included in `docker-compose.yaml`, and includes a GUI that can be accessed at
`http://localhost:8025`.

Create an `Author`:

```bash
$ curl -w "\n" -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "James Patterson", "dob": "1974-3-22"}' http://localhost:8000/v1/authors
{"id":"6f395bdf-3e77-481d-98b2-3471c2342654","created":"2022-10-09T23:18:10","updated":"2022-10-09T23:18:10","name":"James Patterson","dob":"1974-03-22"}
```

Then check the `mailhog` GUI to see the email that has been sent by the worker.
